# Graph Domain Adaptation via Theory-Grounded Spectral Regularization

PyTorch implementation for [Graph Domain Adaptation via Theory-Grounded Spectral Regularization](https://openreview.net/forum?id=OysfLgrk8mk)

Yuning You, Tianlong Chen, Zhangyang Wang, Yang Shen

In ICLR 2023.

## Overview

This repo provides two GNN spectral regularizations to tackle distribution shifts for graph data (i.e. graph domain adaptation).
The developed regularization is built on the model-based risk bound analysis in the paper (Corollary 1, Lemma 1, and Lemma 2).
